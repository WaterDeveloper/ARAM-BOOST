# ARAM-BOOST
 A simple Aram Boost Exploit made in Python.
 
## HOW TO USE
This exploit was fixed in version 11.3 of League of Legends but if you modify the [client unofficially](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18_9qZgah33oA9aJioE55hChmewXEPqbm/edit) it still works.

Bearing in mind that being an exploit and modifying the LCU the ban rates are high.


For this to work you will need the latest version of Python and the [LCU-Driver](https://github.com/sousa-andre/lcu-driver)
